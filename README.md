# Ether_SavingBox
the ether_savingBox project is a project that mimics real life piggy bank or traditional saving box
the saving box recieves ethers and allows you to set a withdrawal limit, meaning a withdrawal from the account can only be made when the balance is egual to the withdrawal limit
the withdrawal limit is initiated to zero, meaning if a withdrawal limit is not set, funds of any amount can always be withdrawn
transactions are made in big numbers ie *e18
